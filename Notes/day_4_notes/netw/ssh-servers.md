### Option 1: Free Public SSH/Tunnel Servers

Several websites offer **free temporary SSH accounts** (typically valid for 3–7 days), perfect for quick testing and learning.

* **FastSSH & similar providers**
  Offer free SSH accounts for durations like **3 days** or **1 month**, often with multiple regional options (including India, Singapore, US, Europe). Ideal for lightweight SSH session testing or tunneling.([sshservers.com][1], [StunnelSSH][2], [DailySSH][3])

* **OpenTunnel**
  Provides free accounts (e.g., valid for **7 days**) with servers in regions like the US or Germany.([opentunnel.net][4])

* **DailySSH**
  Offers free **3-day SSH accounts**, with servers across many countries (including India!), though note they may support only tunneling (not full shell access).([DailySSH][3])

These services are **fast to set up** with no cost or registration hassle, but are great for short-term use only. They're excellent for testing SSH automation scripts or learning how connections work.

### Option 2: Free Cloud VM (Full Shell Access)

If you need full control over the server environment or want something more persistent, free cloud VMs are a better route:

> “**Oracle cloud gives you free-forever resource… Just setup the ampere VM, you'll have a decently powered linux machine to work with.”**
> “**AWS Free Tier**, **GCE Free Tier**… most or all of them will let you accidentally go over and then bill you.”([Reddit][5])

* **Oracle Cloud Free Tier** – Offers an **always free VM** (Arm-based Ampere) with full root access, ideal for development and testing.
* **AWS Free Tier** – Limited to 12 months, but plenty of time to test automation. Be careful not to exceed free usage limits.
* **Google Compute Engine Free Tier** – Includes small VM (“f1-micro”) with SSH access and free usage within quota.([Reddit][6])

These give you stable, customizable environments, perfect for scripting complex scenarios or installing/testing dependencies like `paramiko`.

### Option 3: Community Shell Accounts

If you're more interested in classic shell access and tinkering:

* **SDF Public Access Unix System** (sdf.org)
  A longstanding free Unix shell service—great for getting a feel for a live multi-user environment.([Wikipedia][7])

Alternatively, folks have recommended other community shell services like `dataswamp.org`, `grex.org`, or similar “tilde” universe servers. These are usually shared environments, so access can require outreach or adherence to usage rules.([Reddit][8])

| ------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Free public SSH servers               | 3–7 days          | Tunneling or limited SSH | Quick testing, learning basics    |
| Cloud free-tier VM (Oracle, AWS, GCP) | Free or 12 months | Full Linux shell         | Robust automation, real scripting |
| Community shell (SDF, etc.)           | Ongoing           | Shared shell access      | Traditional Unix experience       |
