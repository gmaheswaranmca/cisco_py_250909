### Problem 1

Write a Python program that:

1. Accepts a sequence of words from the user in a single line (separated by spaces).
2. Stores the words in both a **list** and a **tuple**.
3. Displays the list and tuple on the screen.
4. Saves the list and tuple into a text file named **`qn01_data.txt`**.
5. Reads back the saved data from the file and prints it on the screen.

### Problem 2

Write a Python program that:

1. Reads a line of integers from the user (separated by spaces).
2. Stores them in a **list** and calculates the **sum and average**.
3. Saves the list, sum, and average into a text file named **`numbers_data.txt`**.
4. Reads the contents of the file and prints them back to the user.

### Problem 3

Write a Python program that:

1. Accepts a sentence from the user.
2. Splits the sentence into words and stores them in a **list**.
3. Converts all words to **uppercase** and stores them in a **tuple**.
4. Saves both the list and tuple into a file named **`sentence_data.txt`**.
5. Reads back the data from the file and displays it on the screen.

### Problem 4

Write a Python program that:

1. Reads a list of names from the user (separated by spaces).
2. Sorts the names alphabetically and stores them in a list.
3. Converts the list into a tuple.
4. Saves the sorted list and tuple into a file named **`names_data.txt`**.
5. Reads and prints the saved data from the file.

### Problem 5

Write a Python program that:

1. Accepts a sequence of numbers from the user.
2. Stores the numbers in a list and finds the **maximum and minimum values**.
3. Stores the results (list, max, min) in a file named **`minmax_data.txt`**.
4. Reads and prints the saved data from the file.
